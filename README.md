## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- A [LINE Developers account](https://developers.line.biz/en/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luthpg/transit-line.git
    cd transit-line
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

This project uses `wrangler` to manage environment variables. For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project. For production, use `wrangler secret put`.

```ini
# .dev.vars

# LINE Bot Credentials
LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET = "..."
LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN = "..."

# Navitime API Keys (RapidAPI or SBU API Hub)
RAPID_API_KEY = "..."
SBU_API_HUB_KEY = "..."

# The LIFF ID from your LINE Developers console
# This can also be set in wrangler.jsonc for non-secret values
VITE_LIFF_ID = "..."
```

### Running Locally

The development server uses Vite for HMR and `wrangler` to simulate the Cloudflare environment.

1.  **For frontend development (Vite Dev Server)**:
    This is ideal for focusing on UI changes with fast hot-reloading.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

2.  **For full-stack local testing (Wrangler)**:
    This runs the application on a local version of the Cloudflare Workers runtime, including backend functions.
    ```bash
    pnpm preview
    ```

## üì¶ Build & Deployment

### Build

To build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command builds both the client-side assets and the server-side worker script.

### Deployment

Deploy the application to your Cloudflare account:

1.  **Set Secrets**:
    Ensure you have set the required production secrets in your Cloudflare project:
    ```bash
    npx wrangler secret put LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET
    npx wrangler secret put LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN
    npx wrangler secret put RAPID_API_KEY
    npx wrangler secret put SBU_API_HUB_KEY
    ```

2.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    pnpm deploy
    ```
    This command automatically builds the project before deploying.
